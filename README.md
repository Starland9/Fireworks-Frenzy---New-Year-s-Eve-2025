## 🎵 Adding Custom Audio Files

The game includes synthesized sounds by default, but you can add custom audio files for a better experience!

### How to add audio files:

1. Create a `sounds` folder in the same directory as `index.html`
2. Add the following MP3 files:

```
sounds/
├── pop.mp3        # Sound when popping a normal firework
├── explosion.mp3  # Explosion sound effect
├── combo.mp3      # Sound for combo milestones (x5, x10, x15, x20)
├── bomb.mp3       # Sound when hitting a bomb (error sound)
├── golden.mp3     # Sound when popping a golden firework
└── music.mp3      # Background music (optional)
```

### Recommended audio:
- **pop.mp3**: Short, satisfying pop sound (0.1-0.2 seconds)
- **explosion.mp3**: Firework explosion sound (0.3-0.5 seconds)
- **combo.mp3**: Upward chime or celebration sound (0.2-0.3 seconds)
- **bomb.mp3**: Error/alarm sound or explosion (0.3-0.5 seconds)
- **golden.mp3**: Magical/sparkle sound (0.2-0.3 seconds)

### Where to find free sounds:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) - Free sound effects
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/) - Free sound effects
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/) - Free sound effects

> **Note**: If audio files are not found, the game automatically uses synthesized sounds as fallback.
